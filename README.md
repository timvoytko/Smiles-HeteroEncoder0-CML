# Smiles-HeteroEncoder-CML
A generative hetero-encoder model was designed based on the recurrent and fully connected neuralnetworks of direct propagation. Training and testing of this model were carried out on a set of chemical
compounds containing 2-arylaminopyrimidine, which is present as the main pharmacophore in the structures ofmany small-molecule inhibitors of protein kinases.
